The webpage is built with react, so the framework needs to be installed to use it. Project can be ran with npm start, but you probably already know that
- The webpage isn't very "pretty", but that's easily fixable if needed.

Python file requies the "requests" module, needs a pip installation as well: pip install requests

That should be all, let me know if you need any help with anything by reaching out to my email: jasonjiang5808@gmail.com
